# CA05 â€“ Logistic Regression

## Getting Started



### Project Overview

This assignment is meant to test our knowledge of the Logistic Algorithm.

### Installing

packages used:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score



## Running the tests

used accuracy and auc test

### And coding style tests

no tests
```

## Deployment

Used Google Colab

## Built With
