# CA03 â€“ Decision Tree Algorithm

## Getting Started



### Project Overview

This assignment is meant to test our knowledge of the Decision Tree Algorithm by using the data provided to predict income of Individuals. Furthermore, we learn about evaluating the models and all the steps that lead to the model being created.

### Installing

packages used:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import time
from sklearn.externals.six import StringIO  
from IPython.display import Image
