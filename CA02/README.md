# NAIVES BAYES CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM

## Getting Started



### Project Overview

This assignment allowed us to use sample data to run code that showed us how the naive bayes algorithm worked. We then had to run it ourselves with our own variables and comments to prove we understood.
There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam category. Next, we shall test the model on 260 emails. We shall ask model to predict the category of this emails and compare the accuracy with correct classification that we already know
